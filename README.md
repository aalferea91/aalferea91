My name is Alejandro Alferez Aroca and I'm a graduated Industrial Engineer by the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid. I have mainly worked in the field of logistics but in 2019 I decided to switch in my proffesional career to the Data field. I restarted then as a Business Analyst in a hospitality startup Draper Startup House and then changed into Consulting at SDG Group as a BI developer which is the role that I'm currently doing. On 2022 I decided to study a Master's Degree in Data Engineering, Big data and Cloud Computing. In this repository I am showcasing projects from both my proffesional experience as a Tableau Developer and as Data Engineer.
